          <h1>Mosquito Dunks</h1>
          <h2>Consequences</h2>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, and most apparent, issue to consider is that selectively eradicating an entire taxon from the ecosystem is going to cause inevitable changes farther up the chain, the severity of which is difficult to predict. This is inherent to any plan that aims to rid the world of mosquitoes as a category.</p>
          
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specific to Mosquito Dunks, they specifically utilize toxins produced by the <i>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</i> bacterium. This raised a bit of a question, as this is in the same genus as Bacillus Anthracis, which causes anthrax. However, studies have been performed indicating that there is no such risk--it is simply an interesting bit of trivia.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the EPA, B. thuringiensis toxins only affect, "the larvae of the mosquito, blackfly and fungus gnat." As someone who is not an entomologist, it is a bit suspicious that fungus gnats are not in the same taxonomic family as the other two, which is slightly concerning with regard to other species in the same order. That being said, something being concerning is not the same as there being evidence of potential harm.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is not yet enough, only very specific genera of mosquitoes carry human pathogens--most famously <i>Anopheles</i> and <i>Aedes</i>, meaning that even if it were to target only mosquitoes, there would still be collateral damage to genera that are not major risks to human health. </p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, most mosquitoes tend to lay eggs in very small amounts of water, meaning that it will be quite difficult and expensive to cover every single square inch where mosquito larvae may grow.</p>
          <h2>Probability</h2>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the area under the provided probability density function actually sums to 1, Maple calculated the necessary value of x to fulfill the given parameters of y=1 and P(x,y) = .99.</p>
          <img src="images/dunks-maple.png" alt="Calculating the conditional probability" width="100%">
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final range that Maple returns is the range in which our parameters are fulfilled, keeping in mind that x is only defined from 0 to 7 inclusive. It is a quite good sign that the lower bound is inside of this range, because if it were not, Kolmogorov would be displeased with us.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially what this calculation means is that in order for us to have complete eradication of mosquitoes with a 99% probability, x must be greater than about 6.989.</p>
          <h2>Cost</h2>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the previous calculation means in reasonable terms is that X is measured in trillions of dollars, indicating that to get the same result at the same confidence as nuking the mosquitoes off the planet, as discussed previously, it will cost on the order of $7 trillion compared to the relatively inexpensive $2 billion.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-bug"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the cost of not irradiating the planet for all of the other species, which almost makes up for the differential.</p>
