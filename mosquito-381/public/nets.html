          <h1>Mosquito Nets</h1>
          <h2>Consequences</h2>
          <p>This was the method that was the least forthcoming with potential issues. It is common for nets to be treated with insecticides, which could carry similar ecological challenges as the following method</p>
          <p>However, the specification makes no mention of this option, so the nets will be analyzed as though this is not a concern.</p>
          <p>Another potential consideration is that it is up to individual people to hang these nets, meaning that if there are individuals who choose to not do so or do so inaccurately, pathogens may still exist in the environment.</p>
          <p>Additional funds may be required for education on how the nets work and why they should be hung up in the first place, which should be considered as an additional cost beyond the nets themselves.</p>
          <p>Another potential issue could be mosquito bites acquired during daytime hours, which may result in the pathogens remaining.</p>
          <p>However, if every person infected with a mosquito-borne disease were to be covered with one of these nets so that mosquitoes cannot bite them and begin carrying the pathogen, then there would no longer be carriers, and this would no longer be a concern.</p>
          <p>Mosquitoes as a clade would still exist, but the main issue is that they carry pathogens. If any of the pathogens that they carry have the ability to affect other organisms, this would have to be a permanent solution, and the nets would likely have to be replaced periodically.</p>
          <h2>Probability</h2>
          <p>Repeating the same process as the previous problem, Maple calculates as such: </p>
          <img src="./images/nets-maple.png" alt="Calculations" width="100%">
          <p>It can be seen that within the defined x values of 0 to 1.2, any value between 0.871 and 1.2 has a sufficent confidence of mosquito eradication.  </p>
          <h2>Costs</h2>
          <p>Each net costs about $2, meaning that if we were to buy 0.871 billion of them, this would cost, in total, about $1.742 billion.</p>
          <p>Somehow this is less expensive than nukes with significantly fewer potential issues.</p>
          <p>Again, a bit more may be required for education, but considering the previous solution would cost trillions of dollars, a couple more dollars per net is still likely less costly.</p>
