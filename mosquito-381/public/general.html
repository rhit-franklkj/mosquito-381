          <h1>General Information</h1>
          <h2>Why Mosquitoes are Dangerous </h2>
          <p>As a member of the order Diptera (Flies), mosquitoes are very common around the world, occuring on every continent except Antarctica. While most are a minor summer nuisance, their presence marked by itchy red blotches due to the skin's reaction to proteins in the mosquito's saliva, others are vectors for various medically significant diseases, most predominantly in tropical regions. </p>
          <p>These infections result in the deaths of more than 725.000 humans annually, accounting for more deaths than any other animal, as well as countless hours worth of days that people have to spend sick with these diseases.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Malaria</h3>
          <p><em>According to the WHO, "Globally in 2023, there were an estimated 263 million malaria cases and 597 000 malaria deaths in 83 countries."</em></p>
          <p>Named as such due to the miasma theory--the idea that diseases are transmitted through "bad air", which has since been superceded by germ theory--Malaria is not, in fact, an airborne pathogen, being that it is carried in the saliva of mosquitoes, which is then transmitted to the unlucky person that gets bitten. </p>
          <p>More specifically, the <i>Plasmodium</i> protozoan, which causes the disease, is carried by <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. </p>
          <p>A protozoan (pl. protozoa) is a Eukaryote--meaning its cells have organelles the same way that animal, plant, and fungal cells do--but it is not a part of one of the above categories, and this makes it difficult to treat as it has much more DNA than most bacteria and viruses, which makes it more susceptible to evolving resistance to antimicrobial drugs</p>
          <p>Once inside the body, the Malaria parasite goes to work ripping apart red blood cells, resulting in flu-like illness, including fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe cases result in symptoms such as anemia--low red blood cell content in blood, making oxygenation difficult--and jaundice--a sign of liver damage.</p>
          <p>Another side effect of prolonged Malaria exposure over an entire population is a higher rate of Sickle Cell Disease and Sickle Cell Trait (the former where the affected invididual has two sickle cell versions of the affected gene and the latter where the individual has one sickle cell version and one normal version), a genetic mutation that causes the Hemoglobin in Red Blood Cells to be folded differently than the general population, which makes the individual less susceptible to Malaria, but it comes with its own side effects, such as increased clotting risk, pain, and organ damage.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Zika</h3>
          <p>Another pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes is the Zika virus. This one is oftentimes more mild than even mild malaria symptoms, with the vast majority of cases being asymptomatic.</p>
          <p>However, severe cases do occur, resulting in Guillain-Barr√© syndrome--this presents with symptoms similar to Polio, Meningoencephalitis--inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain, Myelitis--inflammation of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve cells, and a thrombocytopenia--a deficiency of platelets, resulting in na inability to make blood clot.</p>
          <p>Zika is particularly dangerous in pregnant women, where vertical transmission can result in the infant being infected. This manifests in birth defects, the most infamous of which is the severe microcephaly, where the head is smaller than usual, indicative of the brain being smaller than usual, resulting in developmental delays.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Dengue Fever</h3>
          <p>Transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus <i>Aedes</i>, roughly one in four infected will experience mild dengue fever, presenting with symptoms such as pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting that usually lasts 2-7 days.</p>
          <p>Out of that population, about one in 20 will develop severe illness, which is where Dengue gets its reputation as a hemorragic fever as severe symptoms include bleeding from the nose or gums, vomiting blood, or blood in the stool.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Yellow Fever</h3>
          <p>Another flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus <i>Aedes</i> like Dengue, yellow fever is characterized by a similar pattern of many affected individuals experiencing mild disease, and a small subset experiencing more severe hemorragic disease</p>
          <p>In addition to that, the severe form of the disease can cause liver and kidney damage, often leading to jaundice. This jaundice is what gives Yellow Fever its name.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Chikungunya</h3>
          <p>Thankfully, death from Chikungunya is rare. However, its symptoms are similar to many of the mild forms of any of the other diseases on this list, making a differential diagnosis of any one of them difficult, in addition to joint pain that can be severe and may last several months.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>West Nile Virus</h3>
          <p>Once again following a pattern of many individuals remaining asymptomatic, while only a very small percentage developing severe disease, West Nile Virus takes the title of severe to another level. Neuroinvasive WNV can take the form of meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid myelitis </p>
          <p>Meningitis--inflammation of the meninges, tissues around the brain--is most obviously characterized by a stiff neck, but also presents with fever and headache.</p>
          <p>Encephalitis presents as fever, altered mental status, seizures, and movements disorders.</p>
          <p>Acute flaccid myelitis--inflammation of the myelin sheath that surrounds neurons--presents similarly to the paralysis caused by Polio.</p>
          <p>In addition, WMV has a heightened risk for pregnant women the same way as Zika does, wherein vertical transmission can result in the infant being infected with WNV.</p>
