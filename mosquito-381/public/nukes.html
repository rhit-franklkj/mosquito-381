          <h2 class="general1">Consequences</h2>
          <p>Everything, including humans, would die, except for perhaps a handful of tardigrades. This may not be the ideal solution, but it would mean that mosquitoes would lose their title as the animal that kills the most humans per year, considering that humans would do a full 8 billion within a similar timespan--considering the effects of the explosion, the radiation, and the nuclear winter that would follow, also causing many staple crops to go extinct. It would be quite a lot like the end-Permian extinction (not the one that did the dinosaurs. It's the one right before the dinosaurs), except it happens in a year instead of several million.</p>
          <h2 class="general1">Probability</h2>
          <p>There is a 99% chance the mosquitoes would be eradicated. This would be promising if the consequences were not so severe.</p>
          <h2 class="general1">Cost</h2>
          <p>$2 billion sounds like a lot, but in the aftermath, there would be no such thing as capitalism or even an economy anymore, so that $2 billion almost does not count. This is, however, a useful benchmark for the range of money to expect in the following eradication methods.</p>
