          <h1>Insecticides</h1>
          <h2>Consequences</h2>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different classes of insecticides, and quite a lot of them have adverse effects to other animals, including humans. This is generally suboptimal. As an example, DDT has been shown to reduce the thickness of bird eggshells, making them more prone to cracking, and reducing bird populations.</p>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, there is the consideration that this would eradicate mosquitoes as a clade, meaning that there will be other ripple effects to the ecosystem.</p>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more concerningly, many pests have a tendency to develop resistances to pesticides, meaning that this is not a one-time solution, and more pesticides must be discovered to maintain a low mosquito population, potentially with even more side effects, and at a higher cost with each iteration.</p>
          <h2>Probability</h2>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the same process as the previous methods, Maple calculated the necessary value of X to achieve our goals</p>
          <img src="./images/insecticide-maple.png" alt="Calculation" width="100%">
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a surprising result as the necessary value of X is outside of the defined range from 0 to 7.5.</p>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that there is not a way for this method to meet our predefined goals of 99% probability of complete eradication.</p>
          <p<img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is slightly less surprising when one considers that the provided pdf is linear with respect to X with a coefficient out in front less than one, it makes some amount of sense that it would require a fairly large value of X to achieve the desired probability.</p>
          <h2>Costs</h2>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost is a bit undefined, but the maximum amount that it would be possible to invest is 7.5 billion acres of land * $1000/acre = $7.5 trillion.</p>
          <p><img src="./images/bug.svg" width="25px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to spend this much, by plugging in 7.5 into the conditional probability found above it can be calculated that there would only be about a 23.8% chance of complete eradication.</p>
